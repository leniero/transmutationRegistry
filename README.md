  Introduction

"Transmutation Registry" is a speculative art project exploring the aftermath of a pandemic where a pathogen causes rapid human mutations. It critiques media and healthcare narratives on mental health and reflects on themes of alienation, queerness, and HIV.

  Concept

Inspired by personal experiences and the works of David Cronenberg, the project is set in a dystopian reality where nature, technology, and institutions mutate, symbolizing constant transformation.

  Technical Details

- Languages Used: C++, Arduino
- Key Components: Interactive scanner installation with a TV interface, eye scanner
- Platform: Integration of software and hardware for an interactive experience

  Installation and Setup

  Artistic Concept:
- The installation symbolizes the transformation of human bodies and perceptions, grounded in the narrative of a new pathogenic virus.

  Technical Setup:
- Interactive elements include a custom-built eye scanner with LED lights and camera, connected to a TV displaying the scanning process and results.

  Technology Overview

- The project uses openFrameworks and Arduino to create an interactive experience, with the scanner detecting eye movements and abnormalities, reflecting the project's narrative.

  Usage

- Visitors interact with the installation by undergoing a simulated eye scan, experiencing the project's narrative through visual and auditory elements.

  Reflection and Future Development

- The project is seen as a foundation for exploring similar themes in different mediums, potentially expanding to other installations or interactive experiences.
